    "Successfully refactored all hardcoded color values in the theme definitions to use the `MagicColor` enum:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changes Made:\n",
    "- **Mono-color themes**: Updated all `['W']`, `['U']`, `['B']`, `['R']`, `['G']` to use `[MagicColor.WHITE.value]` etc.\n",
    "- **Dual-color themes**: Updated all combinations like `['W', 'U']` to use `[MagicColor.WHITE.value, MagicColor.BLUE.value]`\n",
    "- **COLOR_IDENTITY_MAP**: Updated to use enum values instead of hardcoded strings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation Results:\n",
    "✅ **All 30 decks constructed successfully**  \n",
    "✅ **All card uniqueness constraints satisfied**  \n",
    "✅ **All deck constraints satisfied**  \n",
    "✅ **390/450 cards used (86.7% usage rate)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The enum refactoring maintains full backward compatibility while providing better code maintainability and consistency across the entire codebase."

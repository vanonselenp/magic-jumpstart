# Magic: The Gathering Jumpstart Cube Constructor

An intelligent deck construction system for building themed Magic: The Gathering Jumpstart cubes with perfect theme coherence and balanced gameplay from a Pauper Cube. 

## Overview

This project automatically constructs 30 themed Jumpstart decks from a card pool, ensuring each deck has strong thematic identity while maintaining balanced gameplay. The system uses a sophisticated multi-phase algorithm with specialized scoring to create cohesive, playable decks.

## How It Works

### Construction Algorithm

The system uses a **5-phase construction algorithm** to build optimal decks:

#### Phase 0: Core Card Reservation  
- Reserves theme-defining cards for each deck before general competition
- Ensures equipment reaches Equipment themes, tribal cards reach tribal themes, etc.
- **Critical innovation** that solved theme coherence problems

#### Phase 1: Multicolor Assignment
- Assigns multicolor cards to appropriate dual-color themes
- Prioritizes color requirements and theme relevance

#### Phase 2: General Assignment  
- Main construction phase using specialized scoring
- Assigns remaining cards based on theme compatibility

#### Phase 3: Completion
- Fills incomplete decks with best available cards
- Maintains constraints while maximizing deck size

#### Phase 4: Validation & Fixes
- Validates all constraint compliance  
- Fixes any violations (excess creatures/lands)

### Specialized Scoring System

Each theme uses **specialized scorers** for accurate card evaluation:

- **Equipment Scorer**: Prioritizes artifacts and creatures that benefit from equipment
- **Tribal Scorers**: Emphasize creature types and tribal synergies  
- **Aggressive Scorer**: Values low-cost creatures and combat tricks
- **Control Scorer**: Prioritizes card draw, removal, and win conditions

### Constraint System

The system enforces realistic deck building constraints:

- **Deck Size**: 13 cards per deck (390 cards total)
- **Creature Limit**: Maximum 9 creatures per deck  
- **Land Limits**: 1 land for mono-color, 3 for dual-color themes
- **Card Uniqueness**: No card appears in multiple decks
- **Basic Land**: 7 Basic land to be added at the end

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - Fast Python package installer and resolver

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanonselenp/magic-jumpstart.git
   cd magic-jumpstart
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment with uv:**
   ```bash
   # Install uv if you don't have it
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   
   # Create virtual environment and install dependencies
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   cd jumpstart
   uv run jupyter notebook jumpstart.ipynb
   ```

### Basic Usage

#### Quick Start - Build All Decks

```python
from src.construct import construct_jumpstart_decks, CardConstraints
import pandas as pd

# Load card database
oracle_df = pd.read_csv('ThePauperCube_oracle_with_pt.csv')

# Set up constraints  
constraints = CardConstraints(target_deck_size=13)

# Build all decks
deck_dataframes = construct_jumpstart_decks(oracle_df, constraints=constraints)

# Analyze results
from src.construct import analyze_deck_composition, print_detailed_deck_analysis
analysis = analyze_deck_composition(deck_dataframes)
print_detailed_deck_analysis(deck_dataframes, analysis)
```

**Running with uv:**
```bash
# Run the notebook
uv run jupyter notebook jumpstart.ipynb

# Or run Python scripts directly
uv run python your_script.py
```

#### Advanced Usage - Custom Constraints

```python
# Custom constraints
constraints = CardConstraints(
    max_creatures=9,        # Maximum creatures per deck
    max_lands_mono=1,       # Lands for mono-color themes  
    max_lands_dual=3,       # Lands for dual-color themes
    target_deck_size=13     # Cards per deck
)

deck_dataframes = construct_jumpstart_decks(oracle_df, constraints=constraints)
```

#### Export Results

```python
from src.export import export_cube_to_csv
export_cube_to_csv(deck_dataframes, 'my_jumpstart_cube.csv')
```

#### Validation and Analysis

```python
from src.validation import validate_jumpstart_cube, analyze_card_distribution

# Comprehensive validation
validation_results = validate_jumpstart_cube(deck_dataframes)

# Distribution analysis  
distribution = analyze_card_distribution(deck_dataframes, oracle_df)
```

## Algorithm Innovations

### Core Card Reservation System

The **Core Card Reservation System** was a critical breakthrough that solved theme coherence issues:

**Problem**: Original algorithm allowed other themes to claim theme-defining cards before the intended theme could access them.

**Solution**: Phase 0 reserves the most important cards for each theme before general competition begins.

**Results**: White Equipment theme improved from 0 equipment cards to 5 equipment cards, with theme coherence jumping from 50% to ~90%.

### Specialized Scoring Integration  

Each theme uses purpose-built scorers that understand the specific strategies:

- **Equipment themes** prioritize artifacts and creatures that benefit from equipment
- **Tribal themes** emphasize creature types and tribal payoffs
- **Control themes** value card draw, removal, and win conditions  
- **Aggressive themes** prioritize low costs and combat effectiveness

## Output Format

The system generates a CSV file with complete deck information:

```csv
Name,Set,Collector Number,Rarity,Color Identity,Type,Mana Cost,CMC,Power,Toughness,Tags
Bonesplitter,Mixed,,common,,Artifact - Equipment,,1,,,White Equipment
Kor Skyfisher,Mixed,,common,W,Creature - Kor Soldier,,2,2.0,3.0,White Equipment
...
```

Each deck is tagged with its theme for easy identification and analysis.

## Contributing  

Contributions are welcome! The modular architecture makes it easy to:

- Add new themes in `consts.py`
- Create specialized scorers for new strategies
- Enhance the constraint system
- Improve card analysis utilities

## Future Enhancements

üí° **Potential improvements:**
- PowerToughnessRatioRule: Score based on P/T efficiency
- ColorRequirementRule: Penalty for hard-to-cast cards  
- SynergyChainRule: Bonus for cards that work well together
- RarityBasedRule: Consider card rarity in limited environment
- MetagameRule: Adjust scores based on format considerations
